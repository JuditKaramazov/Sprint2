# Sprint 2 IT Academy | Landing page


## Getting started with Bootstrap and SASS

What is a `UI library`? How about `Bootstrap` and `SASS`? Why should I consider using this software system (or toolchain) that comes with a collection of components that could make my life `way` easier? Although the first and second questions are completely understandable when we're just starting to dive into this immense area of knowledge, getting in touch with Bootstrap's definition pointing it as one of the most popular CSS frameworks for developing responsive and mobile-first websites should be a reason enough to, at least, give it a try - and that's what we did!
Once we thoroughly studied these new realities, their usage, and advantages, IT Academy proposed a project consisting of replicating `A simple bookmark manager`:

Although that's only a part of the requirements, the entire landing page incorporated:

- the `main content` with its corresponding `navbar`.
- a `features` section explaining the most remarkable characteristics of this (fictional) tool.
- a `download section` including Chrome, Firefox, and Opera versions of the extension.
- a `FAQS` section that allowed us to incorporate an `accordion component`.
- a `footer` with a `Contact us` area that would throw an error whenever the form receives an empty email address or an invalid one.

After working on each part of the landing page and modifying the `active state` of its buttons, links, and tabs, here's the final result:

After all this time, remember... `Don't go hollow` and keep on keeping on! Struggling is just a part of the process - and you're definitely not alone!
